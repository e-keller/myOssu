There are a few problems to solve with my new, refurbished laptop, like the keyboard layout, I need to find certain characters. Also, I need to sort out the user problem on the laptop. My name doesn't show in CMD, only C:\Users\user>. 
I am re-learning variables, experssions and statements on py4e.com.
