There are a few problems to solve with my new, refurbished laptop, like the keyboard layout, I need to find certain characters. Also, I need to sort out the user problem on the laptop. My name doesn't show in CMD, only C:\Users\user>. 
I am re-learning variables, experssions and statements on py4e.com.

Trying to figure out how to delete Microsoft Onedrive from my computer. So far it's been futile, despite of editing even the registry, Onedrive is still affecting the home directories of visual studio code for example. In theory, 'this pc' should mean local libraries, but I have discovered that everything is saved to Onedrive. Most likely, I will need to create a dual-boot laptop with Linux in order to get rid of this microsoft 'virus'.

After a few days of covid, finally I am back. 
I am creating a dual-boot laptop. After a short deliberation, I decided to go for ubuntu es the most popular and most available distro.
I'm following this guide https://www.itechguides.com/dual-boot-ubuntu-windows-10/ Fingers crossed, everything goes well. I'm in for a steep learning curve if something goes bad and I have to fix system problems.
