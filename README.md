My CS degree journey

This repository is about my recorded learning as going through the OSSU curriculum.

I signed up for a Github account, and completed the basics at the Github Learning Lab.
https://www.py4e.com, I finished the second chapter 'Why program?', set up Visual Studio as well.

There are a few problems to solve with my new, refurbished laptop, like the keyboard layout, I need to find certain characters. Also, I need to sort out the user problem on the laptop. My name doesn't show in CMD, only C:\Users\user>. 
I am re-learning variables, experssions and statements on py4e.com.

12-13.08.2022
Changing the Python course to a Udemy one which is more hands on with plenty of exercises to practice.

Trying to figure out how to delete Microsoft Onedrive from my computer. So far it's been futile, despite of editing even the registry, Onedrive is still affecting the home directories of visual studio code for example. In theory, 'this pc' should mean local libraries, but I have discovered that everything is saved to Onedrive. Most likely, I will need to create a dual-boot laptop with Linux in order to get rid of this microsoft 'virus'.

I've just learnt that Github doesn't automatically save edited files. Rookie mistake, I guess I became too comfortable.
Today I am revising Python variables and datatypes, 
how to use the Python interactive shell and the terminal, 
simple data types: integers, floats, and strings.
lists, ranges abd dictionary types
